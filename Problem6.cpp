 *"The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *( 1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the

 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers
