Project Euler Problem 32
Written By Alan Bishop 6/11/14



We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all
the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, 
is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing 
multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
